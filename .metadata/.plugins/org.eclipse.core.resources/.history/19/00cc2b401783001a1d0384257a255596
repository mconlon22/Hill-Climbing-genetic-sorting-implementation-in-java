~~ Task 5 ~~
-Implemented a hillClimbing method which gradually improves the energy of our solution
-The main issue we had was the way to structure accepting worsening random changes we found that on average we improved 1/20 times and that the average 
improvenent was only .675 as opposed to our average worsening of energy of 2.6 meaning that to be improving at a steady rate we need to have a relatively low chance of 
accepting a worsening change because of this we implemented a staleness factor which regulates the temperature based on whether the solution is improving or not.
-the minimum energy found was 41 after leaving it running for 10 minutes
